# Turn a mockup into a website with HTML & CSS
Booki - Find your accommodation for a dream holiday

## Script
You are starting your work-study program as a web developer at the start-up Booki. The company wants to develop a website that allows users to find accommodation and activities in the city of their choice. You are responsible for integrating the interface of the site with HTML and CSS code. For this, you work in close collaboration with Sarah, the CTO, and Loïc, the UI designer.
Sarah sends you an e-mail to tell you about the progress of the project:

    Subject: Booki site models
    From: Sarah
    To you
    
    Good morning,
    
    That's it, Loïc has finalized the desktop, tablet and mobile models of the site! You will be able to
    to integrate. They are available as attachments on Figma. Remember to log in to Figma to
    be able to see all the information about the elements of the model.
    
    You will also find attached the folder containing all the images to be used on the site.
    
    So that the project is very clear, Loïc and I have prepared a summary note for you which brings together the
    specifications and technical constraints to be respected (see attachment).
    So that we can consult the site once finished, you will have to create a folder, compressed
    in ZIP format, with:
    
    ➣ an “index.html” file containing all the HTML code for the project;
    ➣ a “CSS” folder including a “style.css” file containing all the CSS code of the project;
    ➣ an “images” folder containing all the images used.
    
    Good luck with this project, and have a nice day!
    Sarah, CTO @Booki
